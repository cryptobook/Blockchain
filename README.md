## Blockchain

A blockchain is a sequence of linked blocks. Each block contains the hash value of the previous block 
A blockchain can be used as distributed ledger which records transactions in an efficient and verifiable way. Transactions in a block can not be modified without changing all subsequent hash values in the distributed copies of the blockchain.

Blockchains are used by many cryptocurrencies. The blockchain records the transactions of previously unspent cybercoins from one or more input addresses to one or more output addresses. Each new block contains a proof-of-work; by adapting the nonce value a miner has to find a hash value of the new block that is smaller than the network's difficulty target. This requires a very large number of hashing operations which consumes significant computing resources and thus a lot of energy. The miner is rewarded with new cryptocoins. The proof of works also protects the blockchain against manipulations and complicates forks.
